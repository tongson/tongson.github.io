      <description>Most of the DevOps interview assignments involving Kubernetes suggest using minikube. I believe the intent is to gauge a basic understanding of containers and related DevOps tasks. I have skills far from a Kubernetes expert but I hope the interviewing team won&amp;rsquo;t mind if we do a bit of experimenting.
Looking around, I see there are more options for local Kubernetes clusters. I find the kind project a very promising contender.</description>

      <description>A testing strategy that applies to a wide range of software from ToDo to DeFi apps. What&amp;rsquo;s that like? Here&amp;rsquo;s my take on this turbulent topic.
In software, engineers are not engineers by trade. Definitions are mostly made up. Some are luckily agreed upon. A popular software engineer can redefine terms as they see fit and turn public perspective. What I call functional might be integration in someone’s vocabulary. Hopefully, the supporting text might clarify a particular perspective.</description>
