      <description>In a past gig, I was tasked to evaluate container schedulers. The usual suspects Kubernetes and Nomad were the contenders. One huge caveat with the whole exercise is that containers are being scheduled within AWS. You have EKS and ECS but can&amp;rsquo;t move it to on-premises infrastructure in case an inexplicable reason comes up. Looking closely at these schedulers, they are designed for bare-metal fleets. If you have servers across multiple data centers, like a CDN, then Kubernetes is the best out there.</description>

      <description>Most of the DevOps interview assignments involving Kubernetes suggest using minikube. I believe the intent is to gauge a basic understanding of containers and related DevOps tasks. I have skills far from a Kubernetes expert but I hope the interviewing team won&amp;rsquo;t mind if we do a bit of experimenting.
Looking around, I see there are more options for local Kubernetes clusters. I find the kind project a very promising contender.</description>
