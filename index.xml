      <description>So you want to send an email with a confidential attachment. Maybe you just want some privacy. It is reasonable and should be easy. Yes, modern messaging platforms exist but email is so sturdy because of its ubiquity and federated nature.
The Internet standards for email encryption are PGP and S/MIME but no one seems to use them. Properly using PGP or S/MIME requires senders and recipients to be configured to use either.</description>

      <description>This comparison of network equipment was commissioned by a client. I am evaluating Fortinet and SonicWall products. No practical testing was done. This will be a factual objective comparison using publicly available information. Hopefully, the reader will integrate my findings with their own evaluation criteria.
The first impression from my client’s demo experience is that Fortigate had the best coordination and quickest turnaround. SonicWall had some difficulty and delays but eventually delivered a working demo.</description>
