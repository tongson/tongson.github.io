      <description>This comparison of network equipment was commissioned by a client. I am evaluating Fortinet and SonicWall products. No practical testing was done. This will be a factual objective comparison using publicly available information. Hopefully, the reader will integrate my findings with their own evaluation criteria.
The first impression from my clientâ€™s demo experience is that Fortigate had the best coordination and quickest turnaround. SonicWall had some difficulty and delays but eventually delivered a working demo.</description>
